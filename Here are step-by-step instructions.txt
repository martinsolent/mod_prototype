Here are step-by-step instructions to deploy your learning management system as a static website on GitHub:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and sign in (or create an account if you don't have one)
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
Name your repository (e.g., lms-assessment-workflow)
Choose Public (required for free GitHub Pages hosting)
Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
Click "Create repository"
Step 2: Prepare Your Project Files
Download all your project files from Figma Make to your local computer:

Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., lms-project)
Copy all these files into that folder:
/App.tsx
/index.html
/package.json
/vite.config.ts
/tsconfig.json
/tsconfig.app.json
/tsconfig.node.json
/styles/globals.css
/components/ folder (with all component files)
/imports/ folder (if you have any imported assets)
Step 3: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub
Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows), navigate to your project folder, and run these commands:

# Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/lms-project

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit - LMS Assessment Workflow"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME and YOUR-REPO-NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Step 4: Configure for GitHub Pages
You need to update your vite.config.ts file. Add a base property:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/YOUR-REPO-NAME/', // Replace with your actual repository name
})
For example, if your repo is named lms-assessment-workflow, use:

base: '/lms-assessment-workflow/',
Commit this change:

git add vite.config.ts
git commit -m "Configure base path for GitHub Pages"
git push
Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Option A: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended - Automatic)
Create a .github/workflows folder in your project
Create a file called deploy.yml inside it with this content:
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
Commit and push:
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
git push
Go to your GitHub repository settings:

Click Settings tab
Click Pages in the left sidebar
Under "Source", select GitHub Actions
Your site will automatically deploy! Check the Actions tab to see the progress.

Option B: Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If you prefer manual deployment:

Install the gh-pages package locally:
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
Add these scripts to your package.json:
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
Run the deployment command:
npm run deploy
Go to your repository Settings → Pages → Source, and select the gh-pages branch.
Step 6: Access Your Website
Your website will be available at:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/
For example: https://johnsmith.github.io/lms-assessment-workflow/

Important Notes
First deployment takes 5-10 minutes - be patient!
The site updates automatically when you push to the main branch (with Option A)
All data is stored in browser localStorage - it's not a real database
Make sure your repository is Public for free GitHub Pages hosting
Troubleshooting
Blank page after deployment?

Check that you set the correct base path in vite.config.ts
Check the browser console for errors (F12)
404 error?

Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
Check that the deployment completed successfully in the Actions tab
Need to update the site?

Just make changes locally, commit, and push to GitHub
With GitHub Actions, it deploys automatically!
Would you like me to create the vite.config.ts and deploy.yml files for you?
